Welcome to Stellar War!

![Stellar welcome](Demo/stellar-graphics.png)

Mine and @treachGIT summer project.

Here are some functionalities:

You can mark multiple ships and make them move to specific point:
![Ships Movement](Demo/multiple-moving.gif)

Their movement is also smart, they avoid planets and other obstacles:

Marked ships can also attack enemy ones!
![Ships Shooting](Demo/shooting-ships.gif)

Why limit to shooting ships? They can also destroy buildings on planets:

Having destroyed this building lets place some!

@treachGit made **every** object there is in game
I have written (almost) every line of code responsible for these functionalities.
