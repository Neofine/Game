Welcome to Stellar War!

Mine and @treachGIT summer project.

Here are some functionalities:

You can mark multiple ships and make them move to specific point:
![Ships Movement](game_gifs/multiple-moving)

Their movement is also smart, they avoid planets and other obstacles:
![Avoiding Obstacles](game_gifs/avoiding-objects)

Marked ships can also attack enemy ones!
![Ships Shooting](game_gifs/shooting-ships1)

Why limit to shooting ships? They can also destroy buildings on planets:
![Shooting Buildings](game_gifs/shooting-buildings)

Having destroyed this building lets place some!
![Avoiding Obstacles](game_gifs/avoiding-objects)


@treachGit made **every** object there is in game
I have written (almost) every line of code responsible for these functionalities.
